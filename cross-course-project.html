        <p>I feel like this project has haunted me all year, and I kind of wish I could start anew with it. However, by looking at it in its various stages, I can see how much I’ve learned this year, which is kind of cool. The following are the most significant changes I've made since last time:</p>
        
        <h2>Local storage</h2>
        <p>It took me such a long time, but I finally was able to make a button that could remove items from the cart. There are some cart stuff that still should be added, that I hope to learn next year, but to be able to remove items is important for UX, and I’m happy that I made it work after so many frustrating hours. </p>
        
        <h2>Meta description</h2>
        <p>I've added metadiscripton to all the pages to improve the SEO and make the site more accessible.</p>

        <h2>Navigation</h2>
        <p>I've made the navigation fill the screensize when the hamburger menu is open. This makes the design look more elegant</p>

        <h2>User Interaction</h2>
        <p>I’ve added a CTA to the home page, which takes the user to the featured section further down the page. To learn how to do that, I used this resource: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/scroll. I also added the products to the end of the shopping page. These changes lead the user to interact with the page, making them more engaged with the site and its products.</p>

        <h2>Image height</h2>
        <p>On the jacket list pages, I've made the images smaller, so the user don't have to scroll as much. This would be espacally useful if there were more products on the page</p>

        <h2>Redesigning the buttons</h2>
        <p>I redesigned my buttons kind of by accident when I was making the cta on the home page. I liked the new buttons more, as they look more like buttons with the shadowing and because they look more elegant.</p>

        <h2>Cleaning up the code</h2>
        <p class="bottom">I’ve removed unnecessary console.logs and other pieces of code that shouldn't be there, to make the code more readable.</p>
