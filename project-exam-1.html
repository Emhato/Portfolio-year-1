        <p>The project exam is my last project, and fortunately I found it to be the one that needed the least amount of changes. Here are the ones I made:</p>
        
        <h2>Read more buttons</h2>
        <p>When I delivered my project exam, I believe the read more button on the home page worked, but I must have made some changes just before I delivered that made them not work. That is not fixed.</p>

        <h2>Logo</h2>
        <p>I added a logo. This is good for the user to familiarise themselves with the business, and it’s also a way for the user to find her way back to the home page </p>

        <h2>Semantics</h2>
        <p>The logo also made it so that I could use the h1 more semantically correct. I also changed the blog divs to articles.</p>

        <h2>Cleaning up the code</h2>
        <p class="bottom">I’ve removed unnecessary console.logs and other pieces of code that shouldn't be there, to make the code more readable. I discovered, for instance, that I had forgotten to remove the circle carousel on home.js. The code on that page is more than long enough beforehand, and it was easier to fix problems within the code when the circle-thingys were removed.</p>
