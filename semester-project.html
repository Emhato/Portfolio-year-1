        <p>The way I had written the layout of the semester project was very different from the way I would have done it now, but since it worked on all the pages except for the home page, I didn’t plan to change it too much. After changing the home page, however, everything else got a bit messed up, so I figured it would be easier to start fresh with the layout of all the pages. </p>
        
        <h2>Flexbox</h2>
        <p>Before, the page layouts were based on CSS grid. CSS grid is an awesome tool, but I prefer to use flexbox when it easily can be used instead as it's less complicated, demands less code and thereby makes it easier to use. Now the only page that uses grid, Is the home page. </p>
        
        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <p>When I did the semester project, I hadn’t learned Javascript yet. I used to improve the hamburger menu, by changing the hamburger to a cross when it’s tapped. I also changed it to be on the right side. This is a personal preference thing. I have small hands and am right handed, so a menu on the right hand side is more reachable to me. I also used javascript to make an image carousel on the home page. This makes the user more likely to interact with the site, which is always good. </p>

        <h2>Navigation</h2>
        <p>I've made the navigation fill the screensize when the hamburger menu is open. This makes the design look more elegant. As the rest of the content is centered, I also made the desktop navigation centerd to fit the overall impression better.</p>

        <h2>Redesigning CTA</h2>
        <p>I got some feedback that the button looked more like highlighted text than a button. I agreed, so I changed it. Now, it stands out more with the gradient background and the box-shadowing. </p>

        <h2>Logo</h2>
        <p>I added a logo. This is good for the user to familiarise themselves with the business, and it’s also a way for the user to find her way back to the home page </p>

        <h2>Footer</h2>
        <p>I added a bottom menu in the footer. Now the user knows that they have reached the bottom of the page, and they can also use it as navigation. It makes the site look more professional and finished. </p>

        <h2>Cleaning up the code</h2>
        <p class="bottom">I’ve removed pieces of code that shouldn't be there, to make the code more readable.</p>
